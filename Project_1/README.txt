Instruction:
Copy and paste python codes to a CSV file. Each line of code will be placed in a cell. The program will read the CSV file. It will identify if a line of code contains syntax errors. The program will then calculate the accuracy of the predictive model and the accuracy of the codes.


Classifiers:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Naive Bayes
3. KNN
4. SVM
5. Decision Tree
